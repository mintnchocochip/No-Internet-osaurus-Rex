## Overview

The Arduino Dino Game is a recreation of the popular offline game found in Google Chrome. Players control a dinosaur character, making it jump to avoid obstacles. The game's difficulty increases as the player's score grows.

## Materials Required

- Arduino UNO board
- LCD display
- Switch key (Joystick)
- Custom PCB
- Buzzer (optional, for sound effects)

## Game Mechanics

1. **Movement**: Use the switch to control the dino's jumping.
2. **Obstacles**: Randomly generated trees appear on the screen, which the player must avoid.
3. **Scoring**: The player's score increases as they progress.
4. **Game Over**: Triggered upon collision with an obstacle.
5. **Restart**: Players can restart the game to try and beat their high score.

## Installation

1. Connect the hardware components according to the circuit diagram (not provided in this README).
2. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
3. Install the LiquidCrystal library if not already present.
4. Copy the provided source code into a new Arduino sketch.
5. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Power on the Arduino.
2. Press the switch key (A4) to start the game.
3. Use the switch to make the dinosaur jump and avoid obstacles.
4. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Code Structure

The main components of the code include:

- Game initialization
- Main game loop
- Character and obstacle generation
- Input handling
- Collision detection
- Score tracking
